ðŸ“‡ CodSoft Internship Task 5 Completed!

ðŸ”¹ Project: Contact Management System in Python

Iâ€™m excited to share the completion of my fifth project under the CodSoft Internship Program â€” a Contact Management System developed using Python.

ðŸ§  Key Features:

âœ… Add new contacts (Name, Phone, Email, Address)

âœ… View all saved contacts

âœ… Search contacts by name or phone number

âœ… Update existing contact details

âœ… Delete contacts with confirmation

âœ… Clean and interactive command-line interface

This project helped me reinforce my understanding of CRUD operations, user input handling, and data structuring using Python dictionaries and lists. It also gave me a strong foundation in how real-life systems manage contact data.

Looking forward to learning more and building stronger applications in the coming tasks! ðŸš€
